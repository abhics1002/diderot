	//
	// WARNING: It is imperative that the Resource and the underlying [proto.Message] not be modified
	// after insertion! This resource will be read by subscribers to the cache and callers of Get, and
	// modifying the resource may at best result in incorrect reads for consumers and at worst panics if
	// the consumer is reading a map as it's being modified. When in doubt, callers should pass in a deep
	// copy of the resource. Note that the cache takes no responsibility in enforcing this since cloning
	// every resource as it is inserted in the cache may incur unexpected and avoidable costs.

	IsSubscribedTo(name string, handler ads.SubscriptionHandler[T]) bool
	// Subscribe registers the handler as a subscriber of the given named resource. The handler is always
	// immediately called with the current values of the entries selected by this call, even if it was
	// already subscribed.
	//
	// If the name is ads.WildcardSubscription, the handler is registered as a wildcard subscriber. This
	// means the handler will be subscribed to all existing entries, and be automatically subscribed to
	// any new entries until a corresponding call to Unsubscribe is made.
	//
	// If the name is a glob collection URL, the handler will be subscribed to all entries in the
	// collection, along with being automatically subscribed to any new entries. If the collection is
	// empty, the handler will receive a deletion notification for the entire collection. This behavior
	// is defined in the [TP1 proposal]:
	//	If no resources are present in the glob collection, the server should reply with a
	//	DeltaDiscoveryResponse in which the glob collection URL is specified in removed_resources.
	// The subscription will be preserved even if the glob collection is empty (or becomes empty) until a
	// corresponding call to Unsubscribe is made.
	//
	// Otherwise, the handler will be subscribed to the resource specified by the given name and receive
	// notifications any time the resource changes. If a resource by that name does not exist, the
	// handler will immediately receive a deletion notification, but will not be unsubscribed until a
	// corresponding call to Unsubscribe is made. See the [spec on deletions] for more details.
	//
	// Note that there are therefore three ways to subscribe to a given resource:
	//  1. The simplest way is to explicitly subscribe to a resource, via its name. Such a subscription is
	//     it can only be cancelled with a corresponding call to Unsubscribe. It will not, for example, be
	//     cancelled by unsubscribing from the wildcard. This is by design, as it allows clients to discover
	//     resources by emitting a wildcard subscription, finding which resources they are interested in,
	//     explicitly subscribing to those then removing the implicit subscriptions to other resources by
	//     unsubscribing from the wildcard. This is outlined in the [sample xDS flows].
	//  2. If the resource's name is a URN, a subscription to the matching glob collection URL will
	//     subscribe the given handler to the resource. Similar to the explicit subscription listed in 1.,
	//     unsubscribing from the wildcard will not cancel a glob collection to a resource, only a
	//     corresponding unsubscription to the collection will cancel it.
	//  3. A wildcard subscription will also implicitly create a subscription to the resource.
	//     subscribe
	//
	// Note that while the xDS docs are clear on what the behavior should be when a subscription is
	// "upgraded" from a wildcard subscription to an explicit subscription, they are not clear as to what
	// happens when a subscription is "downgraded". For example, if a client subscribes to a resource "A"
	// then subscribes to the wildcard, should an unsubscription from the wildcard cancel the
	// subscription to "A"? Similarly, the docs are unclear as to what should happen if a client
	// subscribes to the wildcard, then subscribes to resource "A", then unsubscribes from "A". Should
	// the original implicit subscription to "A" via the wildcard be honored? To address both of these,
	// the cache will preserve all subscriptions that target a specific resource. This means a client that
	// subscribed to a resource both via a wildcard and an explicit subscription (regardless of order) will
	// only be unsubscribed from that resource once it has both explicitly unsubscribed from the resource and
	// unsubscribed from the wildcard (regardless of order).
	//
	// It is unsafe for multiple goroutines to invoke Subscribe and/or Unsubscribe with the same
	// SubscriptionHandler, and will result undefined behavior.
